This doc is to solve the misalignment issue of PUF-ID signals 
 
# About dataSet:
 Only retain 5 examples due to research confidential
 1D signal with length of 2556 (sampling frequency ~= 0.5 nsec) 
 
# Two models:
 1. Realignment: Classification based on ResNet
 2. Denoise: Signal reconstruction based on Encoder-Decoder / U-net
